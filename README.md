i dont know what im doing!!!!!! ill fancy it when i figure that out!

im astro! I am prone to big emotional outbursts, and might try to seclude myself during those periods

i dont like doubles - im sorry, they give me anxiety attacks, and it's for my own good.

i follow my friends / people I know, that's it. I mention my family in my profile!!

please please dont approach me if i dont know you ... it makes it a whole lot awkward, because I can come off as dry or cold!!!!

also, if I don't associate with you, keep my name out of your mouth. I can be rude/harsh if you decide to give me that energy first.

i am unfortunately very aggressive sometimes ... pls call me out if i make u uncomfortable :'). alsosoo i dont pick up on tones too quick so if ur being subtle i probabblyyy wont even notice... sorry!!!!!

i may look scary but im not. i promise. I just wont be able to have a comfortable full blown conversation at first talk .
